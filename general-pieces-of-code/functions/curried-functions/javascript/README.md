Let's walk through this code step by step:

```js
const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
```

This is a **curried function**. It returns a function:

* When you call `multiply(2)`, it returns a new function that multiplies any input `b` by 2.
* So, `multiply(2)(5)` would return `10`.

---

```js
const operations = [multiply(2), multiply(3)];
```

Here, you're creating an array of **functions**:

* `multiply(2)` returns a function that doubles a number.
* `multiply(3)` returns a function that triples a number.

So `operations` looks like:

```js
[
  function(b) { return 2 * b; },
  function(b) { return 3 * b; }
]
```

---

```js
const result = operations.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), 5);
```

You're using `.reduce()` to apply each function in `operations` **in sequence**, starting with an initial value of `5`.

Breakdown:

1. Initial `acc = 5`
2. First function: `fn = multiply(2)` → `fn(5) = 10`
3. Next function: `fn = multiply(3)` → `fn(10) = 30`

So the `result` is `30`.

---

### Final Output:

```js
console.log(result); // 30
```

### Summary:

This code composes a pipeline of multiplication operations and applies them in sequence:

* First multiply by 2
* Then multiply the result by 3
  → Result: `5 → 10 → 30`

You could imagine this as a functional version of:

```js
const result = 5 * 2 * 3;
```

But done via **function composition** using higher-order functions.
