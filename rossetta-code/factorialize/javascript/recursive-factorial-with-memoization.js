/* 
Good if: 
- You're calling factorial(n) multiple times with overlapping values 
  (e.g., in a loop or inside another recursive function like calculating combinations).
- You're solving dynamic programming problems where subproblems repeat.
- Performance matters, and avoiding repeated computation is key.


NOT if you're just computing factorial(n) once â€” the overhead of memoization doesn't help and may even slow things down.
