# Rosetta Euler Challenges

This repository is a personal collection of solutions to programming challenges from both [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Implemented mainly in Python and JavaScript, these solutions serve as a study and reference resource.

## Repository Structure

- `/rosetta-code` — Tasks from Rosetta Code, organized by task name or number  
- `/project-euler` — Problems from Project Euler, organized by problem number  

## Usage

Feel free to browse and use the code for learning or reference purposes.

## About Rosetta Code and Project Euler

- **Rosetta Code** demonstrates how the same programming tasks can be done in multiple languages.  
- **Project Euler** offers mathematical and computational problems that require efficient algorithms.
